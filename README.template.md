## Feature

- ✅ Supports image, audio, and video media that can be played in your web browser! (Supported media types depend entirely on your environment.)
- ✅ Because it's web-based, you can run multiple instances (multi-window support), use it on smartphones and tablets, and even install it as an app!
- 🚫 Because it's web-based, playlists cannot be saved. (Technically possible, but not practical, so it's not implemented.)
- 🚫 Because it's web-based, background playback and timers do not work reliably.
- ✅ Safe shuffle playback (prevents issues such as media that never gets played or a just-played item playing again immediately.)
- ✅ Stretch settings to control how much content can exceed the screen size, preventing excessive enlargement.
- ✅ Padding settings to fill extra space with enlarged content.
- ✅ Various visualizers based on volume, waveform, and frequency.
- ✅ Stylish analog clock display
- ✅ Crossfade transitions: Alpha, Blur, Wipe, Random
- ✅ Weather, clock, date, calendar, and visualizer can be overlaid.
- ✅ Keyboard shortcut style presets: Apple Music, YouTube, Spotify, Windows Media Player
- ✅ Generally, when small images (such as pixel art) are enlarged in a web browser, they become blurry, but this player displays them sharply using pixelated rendering.
- ✅ Full offline support for all features except weather display (weather requires an Internet connection)
- ✅ For practical browser compatibility, everything that doesn't need to be split into a separate file is embedded in index.html. This reduces requests and enables very fast loading, so the single index.html file provides nearly all functionality with minimal issues.
- ✅ FPS display
- ✅ Multi-language support: __LANG_LABEL_LIST__

## How to add a supported language

Create a JSON file for the language you want by copying one of the existing language JSON files in the [./resouce/lang/](./resouce/lang/) directory, then run the build. The Web Manifest, README.md, and other necessary files will be generated automatically and the language will be added.
