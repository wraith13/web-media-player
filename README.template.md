## Feature

- ✅ Supports image, audio, and video media that can be played in your web browser! (Supported media types depend entirely on your environment.)
- ✅ Since it's web-based, you can easily run multiple instances, use it on smartphones and tablets, and even install it as an app!
- 🚫 Since it's web-based, playlists cannot be saved. (Technically possible, but not practical, so it's not implemented.)
- ✅ Careful shuffle playback! (Prevents issues such as media that never gets played, or media that was just played being played again immediately.)
- ✅ Stretch settings to control how much content can exceed the screen size, preventing excessive enlargement.
- ✅ Padding settings to fill extra space with enlarged content.
- ✅ Crossfade support
- ✅ Weather, clock, date, and calendar can be overlaid.
- ✅ Generally, when small images (such as pixel art) are enlarged in a web browser, they become blurry, but this player displays them sharply using pixelated rendering.
- ✅ Multi-language Support: __LANG_LABEL_LIST__
